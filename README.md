## Goals

Improve Matlab Knowledge  
Learn Python/Go/Fortran/C (for fun), to write architecture portable code, hence why I own systems with a variety of architectures.  

(Astro)Physics MSc/PhD. I have a BSc already, however, that seems like a lifetime ago.

## Upcoming Projects

Gas Turbine Modelling Framework in C, Fortran, Python and/or Octave/Matlab  
CFD modelling of Swing Bowling in Cricket
